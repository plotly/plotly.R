Added a dependency on htmlwidgets and 'offline' plots are now the default. If you want to create a figure on a plotly server, you need to use `plotly_POST()`. Also added a `config()` function to control the default appearance of the interactive plot

1.0.10 -- 3 Nov 2015

Fixed #292.

1.0.9 -- 28 Sep 2015

Fixed filename, fileopt arguments in plot_ly. Specifying the same filename will now overwrite the plot if it exists.

Added the plotly_IMAGES() function which interfaces to the images endpoint https://api.plot.ly/v2/#images

Details -> https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/pull/279

* last_plot() will now look for the last plotly object; if not found, it will try to find the last ggplot object.
* Officially added the filename, fileopt, and world_readable arguments to plot_ly() and ggplotly().
* If plotly offline is not available, the shiny.launch.browser option is changed to open a web brower. See #245.
* Various namespace/documentation improvements for R CMD check.

1.0.1 -- 2 Aug 2015

Removed the stream() function as it wasn't ready to be included.

1.0.0 -- 31 July 2015

A major reworking of package internals which includes a few backwards incompatible changes.

Major changes include:

(1) New high-level grammar for expressing Plotly graphs from R (see the `plot_ly()`, `add_trace()`, `layout()`, and `style()` functions).
(2) New print methods which make it easier to create, modify, and embed Plotly graphs.
(3) Added a `subplot()` function for putting several graphs on a single page.
(4) Added the `renderPlotly()` and `plotlyOutput()` functions for embedding plotly graphs in shiny applications.
(5) Added `offline()` function for creating standalone HTML pages via Plotly Offline (see http://purchasing.plot.ly/)
