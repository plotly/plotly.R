4.0.0 

MAJOR CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

* Formulas (instead of plain expressions) are now required when referring to variable names. For example, `plot_ly(mtcars, x = wt, y = mpg, color = vs)` should now be `plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, color = ~vs)`. This is a major breaking change, but it is necessary to ensure that evaluation is correct in all contexts (as a result, `evaluate` argument is now deprecated). It also has the benefit of being easier to program with (i.e., writing your own custom functions that wrap `plot_ly()`). For more details, see the [lazyeval vignette](https://github.com/hadley/lazyeval/blob/master/vignettes/lazyeval.Rmd)
* The central object (i.e., the return value and first argument to functions) is now an htmlwidget object (instead of a data frame with a special attribute tracking visual mappings). As a result, plotly objects can now be serialized across R sessions and avoid [memory leak issues](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/1151). This also implies that arbitrary data manipulation functions can no longer be intermingled inside a plot pipeline, but plotly methods for dplyr's data manipulation verbs are now provided (see `help("plotly-data")` for more details).
* The `group` argument is deprecated. Groups should be added to the data via `dplyr::group_by()`. Also, groupings will no longer create multiple traces (fixes #418, #381, #577).
* The `inherit` argument is deprecated. Any arguments/attributes specified in `plot_ly()` will automatically be passed along to additional traces added via `add_trace()` (or any of it's `add_*()` siblings).

Traces created via `add_trace()` (or, more generally, by any `add_*()` function), will inherit _required_ attributes from parent traces.


NEW FEATURES & IMPROVEMENTS:

* Error checking for trace types and their attributes. Also added a `show_attributes()` function to obtain information about trace attributes.
* New `add_points()`/`add_lines()`/`add_text()` functions provide a shorthand for common plots.
* New `toWebGL()` function for easy conversion from SVG to WebGL.
* New `export()` function makes it easy to save plots as png/jpeg/pdf (fixes #311).
* `layout()` is now a generic function and uses method dispatch to avoid conflicts with `graphics:layout()` (fixes #464).
* Added a `plotly_spec()` function for inspecting the data sent to plotly.js (as an R list or JSON).


3.6.2 -- 24 May 2016

CHANGES: 

Removed unnecessary plyr dependency.

3.6.1 -- 23 May 2016

NEW FEATURES & CHANGES:

* Many improvements to the subplot() function:
  * ggplot2 objects are now officially supported (#520).
  * Several new arguments allow one to synchronize x/y axes (#298), height/width (#376), hide/show x/y axis titles.
  * A list of plots can now be passed to the first argument.
  * A new vignette with examples and more explanation can be accessed via `vignette("subplot")`.

* ggplotly() is now a generic function with a method for ggmatrix objects.
* plotly_build() is now a generic function. 

BUG FIX:

3.5.5 -- 5 May 2016

CHANGES:

layout.annotations) for axis titles on non-faceted plots. 
This will make for a better title placement experience (see #510).

BUG FIX:

Space for interior facet_wrap() strips are now accounted for.

3.5.4 -- 5 May 2016

BUG FIX:

gg2list() now returns an object of class "plotly_built" instead of "plotly"

3.5.0 -- 19 Apr 2016

NEW FEATURES:

The toRGB() function will now respect alpha channels in hex color codes and can recursively apply alpha. 

CHANGES:

The toRGB() function will always output color codes with an alpha channel (e.g. toRGB('black') is now 'rgba(0,0,0,1)' instead of 'rgb(0,0,0)')

3.4.15 -- 18 Apr 2016

BUGFIX:

The alpha in geom_smooth was incorrectly inheriting from other layers. See #551.

CHANGES:

Upgrade to plotlyjs v1.8.0 -- https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.8.0

Fixed #514.

3.4.5 -- 17 Mar 2016

BUGFIX:

Fixed #514.

3.4.4 -- 17 Mar 2016

BUGFIX:

Show discrete positional values in tooltip (see #515); better GeomTile conversion; pass plot object into layers2traces.

3.4.3 -- 14 Mar 2016

BUGFIX:

Custom facet labeller functions will now translate correctly. See #507.

3.4.2 -- 14 Mar 2016

BUGFIX:

3.4.1 -- 13 Mar 2016

BUGFIX:

Legend titles are now supported.

3.4.0 -- 12 Mar 2016

NEW FEATURES:

* geom_map() and geom_hex() are now supported.

CHANGES:

* The default value of the fileopt argument was changed from "new" to "overwrite".

BUGFIX:

* Made a number of bugfixes/improvements to hoverinfo & conversion of geom_tile()/geom_point().

3.3.1 -- 10 Mar 2016

CHANGES:

* Changed the mapping argument name to tooltip (which seems like a better name).

BUGFIX:

* Redundant legend entries are no longer shown.

3.2.1 -- 10 Mar 2016

BUGFIX:

* Proper formatting for date tooltips.

3.2.0 -- 10 Mar 2016

CHANGES:

* Legend titles no longer appear in legend entries.
* Tooltips now reflect aesthetic mappings. This makes it easier to decode 
data values from a given visual marking.

NEW FEATURES:

* geom_violin() is now supported.
* ggplotly() gains a mapping argument to control the set of aesthetics to appears in the tooltip as well as their order.

3.1.0 -- 8 Mar 2016

CHANGES:

* The "hidden" sharing option in plotly_POST() was renamed to "secret".
* The default value in the scale argument in plotly_IMAGE() is now 1.

3.0.0 -- 8 Mar 2016

NEW FEATURES:

* ggplotly() is now about 20x faster (it avoids calling ggplot_build() 20+ times). In some cases, it might be even faster since a lot of other redundant computation is avoided.

CHANGES:

* Instead of (trying to) translate both major and minor grid lines, we now translate only major grid lines. This generally produces a result closer to the actual ggplot2 result since ggplot2 doesn't draw ticks on minor grid lines.

BUG FIXES:

* ggplotly() now supports most of scale_*()/theme()/guides(). As a result, this fixes a lot of issues (#482, #481, #479, #476, #473, #460, #456, #454, #453, #447, #443, #434, #422, #421, #399, #379, #378, #357, #318, #316, #242, #232, #211, #203, #185, #184, #161). In order to support all of scale_x_*() an scale_y_*(), we always use linear axis types, and supply ticktext/tickvals to plotly.js. This has some unfortunate consequences on hoverformatting, which may be addressed in future releases of plotly.js -- https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/320

2.5.0 -- 1 Mar 2016

NEW FEATURES

* New event_data() function provides easy access to plotly events in shiny.
For an example, see https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/tree/master/inst/examples/plotlyEvents

* plot_ly() and ggplotly() gain a source argument to differentiate between 
plotly events in shiny apps with multiple plots. ggplotly() also gains width 
and height arguments.

CHANGES

The arguments filename, fileopt, world_readable in ggplotly() were removed as
they should be provided to plotly_POST() instead. 

2.4.4 -- 13 Feb 2016

as.widget() now returns htmlwidget objects untouched. See #449.

2.4.3 -- 11 Feb 2016

(4) Added the `renderPlotly()` and `plotlyOutput()` functions for embedding plotly graphs in shiny applications.
(5) Added `offline()` function for creating standalone HTML pages via Plotly Offline (see http://purchasing.plot.ly/)
